## Equipment and Magic Items
- Buy your items [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15M2iALCDVNVZhqjDVX0FJZj1vQRqYXW_9E169s9kJ3U/edit#gid=0). This includes new items from SCC and TCE. Also, note that most prices here are different from the Sane Magical Prices PDF we've used in the past.
- The data in the other tabs are filter by rarity, type of item, and attunement requirements.
- For the 'Spellcaster' tab, these are the non-spellcaster classes, but has a subclass that can cast magic, i.e. Arcane Trickster Rogue and Wild Magic Barbarian.

## Reminders
- Spellcasters can only use spell scrolls that are part of their class' spell list.
- REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN ONLY BE ATTUNED TO 3 ITEMS AT A TIME. Attunement to an item requires 1 hour, but you can be already attuned to your items before the start of the one-shot.
